# NANDA-Native-Internet-of-Agents-Simulation
Streamlit control center linking registry, supplier, logistics, and buyer agents. It turns text intent into a BOM, auto-sources Zurich suppliers, sends RFQs, recovers from simulated outages, books shipping, and visualizes exchanges via live graph/timeline. End-to-end flow works; no LLM yet.
